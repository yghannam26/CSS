                    My origami creations, in accordance with the laws of nature, require the use of geometry, 
                    science, and physics. They also encompass religion, philosophy, and biochemistry. Overall,
                    I want you to discover the joy of creation by your own handthe possibility of creation from paper 
                    is infinite.
